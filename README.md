# Reset-Example
Set default browser styles to nothing to create a consistent baseline across all browsers. 
You will have to redefine the default styles on your own!
## Why do resets matter?
1. It's important for creating browser-compatible websites
2. It's an example of using someone else's CSS on **your** website
3. It's a common Front-End Developer Interview question
## Linking
Note that you will have to link to your reset.css code **before all of your other stylesheets!__**
